# Conoway game of live

Any live cell with two or three neighbors survives.
Any dead cell with three live neighbors becomes a live cell.
All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.

# Initializing the game

We will start the game by randomly generating 25% alive cells.
